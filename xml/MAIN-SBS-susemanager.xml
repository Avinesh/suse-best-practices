        <title>Overview</title>
        <para>For many organizations today, keeping systems patched and secure is one of the biggest
            ongoing challenges that systems administrators can face. Both proprietary and open
            source software companies are constantly at work providing updates that fix flaws
            discovered in their software products.</para>
        <para>Adding to the pressures are the requirements imposed by compliance initiatives like
            PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley), HIPAA
            (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), FIPS 140 (Federal Information
            Processing Standard), etc.. Included in most of these <quote>standards</quote> are rules
            that dictate the frequency or time-frames for patching and often these schedules are
            modified because of the severity level of a specific patch.</para>
        <para>Businesses large and small are depending on an ever-changing landscape of applications
            on a wide-range of compute infrastructure. These can include physical and virtual hosts
            and may have complicated application stacks. These applications may have specific kernel
            version dependencies, have strict uptime requirements or be tied to a specific runtime
            environment (like java). They may only be certified on a specific Linux OS release, or
            have a particular set of configuration requirements. There might be extra hardening or
            platform requirements that set these hosts apart from the rest.</para>
        <para>Additionally, many companies have created duplicate host environments like
                <quote>development</quote> or <quote>QA</quote> landscapes that mirror
                <quote>production</quote> to allow for testing or validation of changes. This means
            at least one more complete set of hosts to manage, patch and report on. This increases
            the challenges of meeting a rigorous patch schedule that often requires patching all
            hosts on a quarterly basis (or more frequently for critical vulnerabilities).</para>
        <para>Is there any way to address all of the issues and regain the control of a complicated
            enterprise Linux environment?</para>

            <title>A SUSE Solution</title>
            <para>SUSE Manager delivers best-in-class Linux server management features like
                automated software management, system provisioning and monitoring. It provides a
                unified Linux management infrastructure by standardizing and automating server
                patching and management. These tasks can be performed faster and with fewer errors,
                which improves IT staff productivity while reducing server downtime.</para>

                <title>Definitions</title>
                <para>This document uses the word <emphasis role="bold">landscape</emphasis> to
                    describe one of several groups of Linux hosts. This is commonly used with
                    enterprise software deployments as a way to define the role/quality of a host.
                    Examples include, production (PROD), development (DEV), quality-assurance (QA),
                    user-acceptance/testing (UAT), etc.</para>
                <para>The word <emphasis role="bold">environment</emphasis> is also used. In this
                    document, environment is defined as a physical separation of Linux hosts, like
                    Corporate (CORP), or Store (STORE), or NPE (Non-Production Environment).</para>
                <para>Lastly, the word <emphasis role="bold">Organization</emphasis> is used. SUSE
                    Manager has a concept of organizations and defines them as a separate management
                    environment placed under the default organization that is created during initial
                    installation of a SUSE Manager Server. This is a single parent (like an LDAP
                        <quote>O</quote>) with many child placements (like an LDAP <quote>OU</quote>
                    - restricted to a flat OU structure with no nesting). Organizations in SUSE
                    Manager will typically have separate credentials required to administer them via
                    the Web UI - and any Linux hosts managed by SUSE Manager will be registered into
                    a single organization and only visible there. Keep these definitions in mind as
                    you read.</para>

            <para>The Chameleon Corporation is the world’s largest reptile and amphibian pet store,
                and has its headquarters in Yemen. It has more than 1500 stores operating under the
                names LizardsRUs, UnVeiledInc and Chameleo-rama in five different countries.</para>
            <para>The Chameleon Corporation has the following requirements for managing patch and
                security updates to their Linux hosts. Because of compliance constraints, their
                patch lifecycle (the timing and delivery) is based on their corporate security
                policies, the host environments/landscapes, and their future management needs. Here
                is a high-level summary of the requirements:</para>
            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The published Security Policy states the need to patch all Linux systems
                        with the latest available updates, bug-fixes and enhancements on a quarterly
                        basis. The quarters are defined as Q1: January 1st through March 31st, Q2:
                        April 1st through June 30th, Q3: July 1st through September 30 th, and Q4:
                        October 1st through December 31st.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The published Security Policy also states the need to patch all Linux
                        systems with <quote>critical</quote> security updates (CVSS score of 7 or
                        greater) within one month of release of the patch. This introduces a second
                        schedule that may overlap any existing patch rollout.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The company has three different host environments, Corporate, Store and
                        NPE - these are partitioned using SUSE Manager Organizations. Each SUSE
                        Manager Organization has visibility into the default SUSE Manager
                        Organization’s software channels because of trusts, yet the managed hosts
                        are naturally grouped and managed by their environment.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>There are at least 3 landscapes in each environment, DEV, UAT and PROD.
                        There are additional landscapes for some environments (for example SIT, DIT,
                        etc.) but these are handled similarly to the aforementioned landscapes.
                        Patch lifecycle promotion simply accounts for moving patches into additional
                        stages as needed.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>A <quote>patch exceptions</quote> process exists, as there is often a need
                        to account for the removal of patches (for example kernel updates) from a
                        rollout. Some hosts might have hardware drivers or 3 rd party software that
                        depends on specific kernel versions. This exception process would be handled
                        on a case-by-case basis.</para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
            <para>In summary, these requirements highlight the need for 2 patch schedules, across 3
                (or more) landscapes, in 3 SUSE Manager Organizations, with a way to handle a
                storage location for patches that cannot be rolled out (exceptions), yet need to be
                tracked, remediated and reintroduced to ensure compliance.</para>
            <para>SUSE Manager can handle these complexities very well and can be set up to allow
                flexible delivery of these requirements. Automation can even be applied to assist
                with some facets, and procedures can be developed to ensure the consistent delivery
                of patches that meet the published company policies.</para>

                Keep this in mind as you read. SUSE Manager is a very flexible product that has
                helped many customers create and deploy solid systems and patch management
                framework. Your requirements may differ from the ones described here, but the

            <para>This guide is based on SUSE Manager 2.1. A fresh installation is not necessary,
                but some assumption is made that you have a working SUSE Manager environment, with
                some registered hosts, and a decent knowledge of the terms and capabilities. The
                SUSE Manager documentation <link
                    xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/suse_manager/"/> is an excellent
                source of information that is often updated. Refer to the documentation for
                clarification of any process that seems confusing. Many of the implementation steps
                detailed in this document are enhanced examples based on procedures, capabilities or
                step-by-step <quote>how-tos</quote> in our product documentation.</para>

                <title>Test Your Implementation</title>
                <para>Some advanced features (like using the spacecmd or the XMLRPC API) will be
                    explained in more detail, but may not be exhaustive. We will include some code
                    examples in the Appendix that can be used as-is, or modified to suit your
                    particular environments or needs. However, these come with <emphasis role="bold"
                        >no warranty</emphasis>, and should not be expected to be perfect for any

            <para>The next section will describe the setup of SUSE Manager to meet the requirements
                defined in the <emphasis role="bold">Scenario</emphasis> section. We will start with
                a description of the architecture (and components) developed to meet the
                requirements, and then proceed with steps to create it yourself. Each component
                within this guide is used together with the others to deliver a comprehensive
                solution in the specific scenario described herein, but might be used individually
                to help you meet your own solution requirements.</para>

    </sect1>
    <sect1 xml:id="sec.implement">
        <title>Implementation</title>
        <para>Let’s review. We need to set up SUSE Manager and create a set of procedures, processes
            and/or tools (scripts) to help us with our patch lifecycle management. This will include
            the creation (and optimally an <quote>automatic</quote> creation) of patch archive
            channels from the SUSE provided <quote>updates</quote> channels for the versions of SUSE
            Linux Enterprise Server we use. These patch archives will be the sources for our patch
            promotions, but can also be a source to set up testing environments based on a patch set
            rolled out in the past. This could be used to troubleshoot an error condition for
            example, by creating a lab full of hosts patched up to any previous patch set. We can
            also demonstrate and visualize a clear view of compliance defined by a time-stamped set
            of patches.</para>
        <para>We also need to create a set of software channels that will get our updates when we
            decide to roll them out. Each landscape needs to receive them from the previous
                <quote>validated</quote> landscape <emphasis role="bold">only</emphasis>. Meaning
            they will first get put into DEV, tested on the machines there - then move into QA, get
            tested - and finally get moved into PROD. The whole thing will start over every quarter,
            and we will handle exceptions if/when they occur. Every exception will be tracked by
            another established process with the constant goal of remediating any exception and
            making sure the patch is reintroduced as quickly as possible to ensure our clear view of
            compliance.</para>
        <para>Other interruptions to a quarterly rollout might be the release of a
                <quote>critical</quote> security patch that needs to be deployed more rapidly than
            once-a-quarter. To handle this extra schedule, we should create an addition channel for
            any critical patches to track them and their roll-out. Critical patches should be
            considered any CVE that has a CVSS score of 7.1 or greater, or otherwise be mandated by
            our corporate security organization. We have two different SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
            versions that we currently manage, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3 and SUSE Linux
            Enterprise Server 12. We want to plan for using SUSE Manager to assist with service pack
            migrations, so setting up to account for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP4 initially
            would be ideal. We also maintain both 32-bit and 64-bit Intel/AMD architecture versions
            of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3 so we will need to account for both of
            them.</para>
        <para>There are two different environments we need to manage, Corporate (CORP) and Store
            (STORE). We have created separate SUSE Manager Organizations to allow our systems
            administrators an exclusive view of the hosts they are responsible for. Each SUSE
            Manager Organization has the three landscapes (DEV, QA and PROD) that they use for patch
            testing/promotion.</para>
        <para>Activation keys and bootstraps should be created for each SUSE Manager Organization
            (each environment) and each landscape so that hosts can be registered into their
            appropriate, and most likely, permanent role. For example, a bootstrap script will
            register a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3 (64-bit) DEV host into the correct
            organization and will add the appropriate base and child channels that should never have
            to be manipulated again. Automation is preferred. As mentioned, the use of scripts or
            scheduled jobs would greatly enhance the solution and provide relief to our
            administration staff.</para>

                To best suit a particular company’s use-cases and product usage, a combination of
                scripts (cron and bash) and a configuration file will be used. The archive creation
                will be triggered by a custom cron job as follows. Criteria for dates will determine
                the exact setup. For example, a quarterly schedule could be implemented based on the
                first or last day of a given quarter. If the trigger time is the <emphasis
                    role="bold">end</emphasis> of a quarter, it would have to consider day 30 on the
                3 rd and 9 th months of a calendar (March and September), and day 31 on the 6 th and
                12 th months (June and December). This will require two crontab entries such as

                for SUSE Manager channel cloning, etc. The script should also loop through each
                architecture and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server version to make a full set of archives
                based on the company’s choices. Processes for patch promotion will be created so
                that administrators can precisely and explicitly define when a patch set is moved
                    <emphasis role="bold">into</emphasis> a given landscape, and just as importantly
                - from <emphasis role="bold">where</emphasis>. The easiest method to do this is
                using a script that leverages the XMLRPC API exposed in SUSE Manager. The API
                contains <quote>softwareChannel methods</quote> called <quote>mergePackages</quote>
                and <quote>mergeErrata</quote>. These two methods can be called with a source
                channel and target channel to quickly take content from one channel and merge the
                differences into another.</para>
            <para>The last process will define a workflow for removing a patch from the promotion
                process - and making sure it is stored to be tracked. These patch exceptions can
                later be reintroduced to a patch rollout calendar as the reason for the exception is
                remediated. In addition to the exception process of <emphasis role="bold"
                    >removing</emphasis> a patch, there is a similar process for <emphasis
                    role="bold">adding</emphasis> a patch as an emergency dictates.</para>
            <para>Emergency patches will likely always be available in the current SUSE Updates
                channels, but might not have been introduced into an Archive channel yet. As the
                quarterly archive channel creation job is triggered, any available patches would be
                part of an archive set - but for a given point in time, this might have occurred
                before the patch was released - or it may be up to 3 months until a new archive is
                created that contains this recent patch. A method for searching and then copying a
                patch into a target channel will need to be created. This will handle those times
                when a critical patch is released by SUSE but your archive channel will not get a
                copy until the quarter is up.</para>

            <para>Understanding how patches (and the packages they include) are obtained from SUSE,
                where they go after download, and how they are arranged within SUSE Manager is key
                to setting up the Advanced Patch Lifecycle system. By default, SUSE Manager arranges
                its channel sets by a particular version and architecture of SUSE Linux Enterprise

            <para>For example, a base set of channels within SUSE Manager for SUSE Linux Enterprise

                functional equivalent of the installation DVD for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11
                SP3 64-bit. Under this pool channel are all of the <quote>child</quote> channels

            <para>A normal set of channels that a managed host subscribes to will include at least a

            <title>Exception and Escalation Channels</title>
            <para>There might be several reasons to delay or remove a patch from a deployment cycle.
                A patch could be causing issues with the stability of a system or systems, it might
                not have passed a testing cycle from the current or previous landscape, or there
                could be some other reason not to deploy it within a patch cycle. On the other hand,
                there might be a reason to deploy a critical patch (one that patches a security
                vulnerability or a debilitating bug) ahead of schedule. Due to the critical nature
                of the patch it needs to go through testing and deployment as fast as possible -
                without waiting for the next quarterly patch cycle.</para>
            <para>To handle the periodic removal or addition of these exception patches, processes
                should be created to track them appropriately. While these exceptions are being
                tracked, they will be copied into their own channel containers for safe-keeping,
                accounting and reporting.</para>
            <para>These channels can be created within the Archive base channel or within the cloned
                base channel for the version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server that corresponds to the
                patch exception (recommended).</para>
            <para>The process for excluding a patch will be to first copy the patch (and associated
                packages) into the Exception Channel, and then to remove the patch (and associated
                packages) from the current deployment landscape. Optionally it can be removed from
                the current quarter’s archive channel but it is important to realize that the patch
                will be included in the following quarter’s archive as well. It might be tempting to
                remove it from the SUSE Updates channel, but this can often lead to a mishandling or
                misreporting of compliance. It is much better to track and resolve the reasons for
                the exception in the first place. This way, the patch can be reintroduced to the
                patch deployment workflow and remediate any potential security issues or code flaws
                that the patch was created to fix.</para>

            <sect3 xml:id="sec.securityescal">
                <title>Security Escalation Channel and Process Definition</title>
                <para>The process for adding a security patch is similar to the process of excluding
                    one. The key difference is that the patch needs to be copied into the Security
                    Exception Channel from either the SUSE Updates channel or the latest archive if
                    it has been created but not used for a promotion cycle yet. Assuming that this
                    new critical security patch has been released in the middle of a rollout phase
                    (you have already been promoting the current quarter’s patches and this new one
                    comes out), it is likely that this new patch has not yet appeared in an
                    archive.</para>
                <para>Another assumption is the need to test this new patch by promoting it through
                    the landscapes as any normal patch set, but if necessary it can be copied
                    directly to any stage. Simply copy this security patch into the initial
                    landscape (for example DEV - Current) and follow the normal deploy-test-promote
                    cycles to get it into production. Depending on the critical nature of the patch,
                    the normal schedule for testing could be accelerated or in rare cases bypassed
                    altogether assuming acceptable risk.</para>

            <title>Channels</title>
            <para>As described in the architecture section above, several custom channels will be
                created to support the patch promotion process. These channels will store the
                archives (created as clones of the SUSE Updates channels) and they will also store
                the exception patches. For each landscape a custom channel will be created to hold
                patches that have been promoted. These channels will contain more and more content
                over time as patches are promoted each cycle.</para>
            <para>For example, during Quarter 1 (Q1) the archive channel contains 159 patches, and
                these are merged into the DEV updates channel for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11
                SP4. As SUSE releases patches in an ongoing fashion, when the next Quarter’s archive
                is created, Q2 for this example - it contains all of the Q1 patches and an
                additional 130 patches for a total of 289. The merge function will take the 130 new
                patches (and associated packages) and add them to the DEV updates channel during the
                next patch cycle.</para>
            <para>Each new patch cycle updates the available patches in a given landscape’s
                    <quote>current updates</quote> channel. In this way each subsequent patch
                promotion adds the new updates and these can be applied to any hosts subscribed to
                the channel.</para>
            <para>The exception channels will be populated by managing individual patches, copying
                them from one of the landscape updates channels or from one of the archive channels.
                When a patch is copied successfully into an exception channel, it can be removed
                from an updates channel or an archive.</para>

                    <title>Service Pack Migration Support with Update and Exception Channels</title>
                    <para>There are a couple of generally accepted methods to managing a set of
                        channels that allows consistent and expected behaviors when leveraging the
                        service pack migration feature. You can find this feature in the software
                        tab of a particular host. It allows you to update the service pack of a
                        particular host in a one-click fashion. When using the patch lifecycle
                        methods described in this document, some challenges arise when using the
                        service pack migration feature. When you select a given host to do a service
                        pack migration, the UI proposes (dictates) a set of mandatory
                            <quote>child</quote> channels that will be subscribed to for a migration
                        action. These mandatory child channels (greyed-out in the UI) will normally
                        include the SUSE provided update channels for a given version of SUSE Linux
                        Enterprise Server.</para>

                        migrations, it is best to create a full clone-set of the SUSE Linux

                    <bridgehead><quote>Exception</quote> Channels:</bridgehead>

                    <para>Now create the two exception channels for each version of SUSE Linux
                        Enterprise Server being managed. While it may be possible to create a mixed
                        channel that is unique to the architecture (like the archive channel base),
                        tracking which distribution a patch exception has come from can get
                        cumbersome. If you mix patches/packages from different versions of SUSE
                        Linux Enterprise Server, it is more difficult to track, resolve and then
                        reintroduce these patches back into the patch workflow. It is much easier to
                        place them into an exceptions channel specifically for the version of SUSE
                        Linux Enterprise Server the patch came from. Create the <quote>Patch
                            Exception</quote> and <quote>Security ASAP Exception</quote> channels as
                        follows:</para>

                                channel within one of the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server pool channels
                                or if you have your own clone set within that pool. This channel
                                will reside next to your landscape channels.</para>

                                - it too will reside next to your landscape and patch exceptions

                            <para>For SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1 and SP2 keep in mind: they
                                reside in the same SP1 Pool base channel, so there will be
                                exceptions and security exceptions channels for each service
                                pack.</para>

        <title>Background</title>

        <para>In every organization, a lot of hidden IT knowledge and experience exists. This is
            also the case for SUSE, no matter which product you are looking at. Our Consultants,
            Sales Engineers, Supporters and also Partners work with our customers on a daily basis
            to implement, strengthen and fine-tune our solutions, to find the best options how to
            install third party software on our operating system, or to get the most out of our
            customer’s infrastructure.</para>

        <para>For every product and solution, there are subject matter experts that have profound
            know-how and skills. Many proof of concepts and customer projects have been conducted.
            And many of them are at least partly documented. But this kind of information is
            normally "buried" on a personal laptop, probably on a team server, but generally not
            publicly available for our colleagues, partners or customers. Also, many Technical
            Information Documents (TIDs) are already written and somewhere on the webpage published,
            but hard to find. </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 xml:id="sec.mission">
        <title>Mission</title>

        <para>The purpose of the SUSE Best Practices is to change this situation, to make existing
            knowledge and experience available to a broader audience, and to promote it via a
            recognizable series of documents. </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 xml:id="sec.vision">
        <title>Vision</title>

        <para>With the SUSE Best Practices, we aim to introduce a new series of documents that
            provides reliable technical information and establishes a new “Go-To” source for the
            usage and implementation of SUSE products and solutions, also in combination with third
            party software and hardware, similar to the famous IBM Redbooks
            (http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/).</para>

        <para>Our goal is to make the SUSE Best Practices so prominent that at a certain stage
            volunteers knock at our door to contribute, and feel honored if we pick their proposed
            topics for our SUSE Best Practices papers.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 xml:id="sec.whatissbp">
        <title>What is a SUSE Best Practices</title>

        <para>In contrast to the SUSE product documentation which mainly guides through SUSE
            software installation and usage, the series of SUSE Best Practices papers provides
            installation and implementation experiences.</para>

        <para>This means a SUSE Best Practices paper describes a technical scenario / solution that
            is not covered by the general and extensive SUSE product documentation. Such a scenario
            can also include third party software and implementations (partly) done by partners. </para>

        <para>While the SUSE product documentation is usually delivered in parallel with a new
            product, the SUSE Best Practices usually will not adhere to newly launched products, but
            to products already introduced to and established in the market.</para>

        <para>Usually the scenario /solution has already been conducted in a real-life scenario at a
            customer's site. It can include – but is not limited to:</para>

        <para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para> a specific, non-common setup</para>

                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>the implementation of a multi-part solution</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>a step-by-step procedure</para>

                    <para>a newly tested procedure</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>a proven process or methodology</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>

        <para>SUSE Best Practices should be replicable and adaptable, they aim to save time as they
            use existing knowledge for further replication, and they should be sustainable and easy
            to update.</para>

        <para>Depending from the complexity of the topic, the SUSE Best Practices might differ
            heavily regarding their length. Typically a SUSE Best Practices paper should be between
            5 and 30 pages in length. </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 xml:id="sec.definition">
        <title>Definition of Whitepapers, Success Stories, Case Studies, Blogs</title>

        <para>SUSE also provides written material to customers which is created under responsibility
            of the Marketing teams, but still is perceived by our customers as part of the
                <quote>documentation</quote> material. To avoid any confusion between the purpose of
            the SUSE Best Practices and Marketing documents such as whitepapers, success stories,
            case studies, and blog entries, the next few paragraphs focus on the definition of these
            documents. </para>

        <para> The target audience for the Marketing documents usually are technical or business
                <emphasis role="bold">decision makers</emphasis>, and they generally target
            potential customers that do not yet run SUSE products, or customers to whom we want to
            upsell additional SUSE products. Marketing documents are mainly used for <quote>Demand
                Generation</quote>. In Marketing language, <quote>Demand Generation</quote> means:
            creating an interest in our products and services, and building and nurturing key
            prospect and customer relationships for the long term.</para>

        <para>Usually, you will find two different kinds of whitepapers at SUSE. There are <emphasis
                role="bold">technical whitepapers</emphasis>. They provide a technical overview and
            are mainly product focused. Here you can find high level technical information, for
            example important technical features or technologies are explained and
                <quote>translated</quote> into their business benefits. These papers are written by
            Product Marketing, but if required, the Doc team supports these whitepapers with
            proofreading, or editing. And there are <emphasis role="bold">Business
                whitepapers</emphasis>. These papers provide a business overview of a product or
            solution and focus mainly on the business value. Business whitepapers are completely
            done by the Marketing teams.</para>

        <para>A <emphasis role="bold">Success Story</emphasis> must include the customer name within
            the story. It is usually only 1-2 pages in length and explains how a customer
            successfully implemented our products in their company and environment. It contains high
            level details of a customer project, direct quotes from the customer, and paints a short
            picture of the project – from start to finish. It covers the problem, solution and
            results from a business perspective, and reveals why our customer chose our product(s)
            for their project. </para>

        <para>A <emphasis role="bold">Case Study</emphasis> provides more details and specifics than
            a success story. In addition to the above, it showcases the <quote>how</quote> - not in
            the meaning of an instruction <quote>how to implement</quote> a product, but how a
            solution was delivered or how the solution works in the customer’s environment. Case
            studies deliver much more in-depth technical information versus a success story. At
            SUSE, case studies are a minimum of four pages, and they must involve tangible
            measurements of results, such as cost savings or increases of efficiency. Their main
            purpose is to describe how a customer did benefit from the implementation of a SUSE
            product or solution by translating the technical information into measurable business
            results.</para>

        <para>SUSE also provides a platform for a <emphasis role="bold">Corporate Blog <link
            xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/communities/blog">https://www.suse.com/communities/blog</link></emphasis>. A
            Corporate blog is a blog that is published and used by an organization as one channel to
            reach its organizational goals. Corporate blogging normally serves multiple potential
            marketing goals, from driving awareness, to providing certain information, to building
            up relationship. The advantage of corporate blogs is that posts and comments are easy to
            reach and follow due to centralized hosting and generally structured conversation
            threads. On a corporate blog, employees, teams, or spokespersons share their personal
            views on certain topics. These topics can be from technical or from business nature. The
            corporate blog is often used to announce new products, to explain and clarify policies,
            or to react on certain issues. It also allows a window to the company culture and is
            often treated more informally than traditional press releases, though a corporate blog
            often tries to accomplish similar goals as press releases do.</para>

    <sect1 xml:id="sec.audience">
        <title>Target Audience</title>

        <para>The SUSE Best Practices usually target existing customers that need to work on a
            specific solution or solve a concrete technical problem. We address mainly system
            administrators that have to set-up and implement the technical solution in their
            companies.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 xml:id="sec.prerequisites">
        <title>Prerequisites for a SUSE Best Practices</title>

        <para>The main purpose for a SUSE Best Practices is not to add work to the Documentation
            team, but to make knowledge that exists in other departments easily accessible for a
            broader audience.</para>

        <para>Thus, the main content for a SUSE Best Practices paper is not delivered by the SUSE
            documentation team, but it usually comes from:</para>

        <para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para> Consulting</para>

            </itemizedlist>
        </para>
        
        <para>One reason why the SUSE documentation team cannot deliver the content is that we
            cannot reproduce the scenarios and environments implemented at our customers
            sites. We heavily rely on the know-how and operating experience of these colleagues that
            are working directly with our partners or customers. </para>

        <para>Minimum 80 percent of a proposed or requested topic already need to be available in
            written form. Before starting with a new project, subject matter experts who worked
            together with a partner or customer on the implementation of the topic need to be
            defined, and they need to be committed to work on the paper together with the
            documentation team. All SUSE Best Practices are written in English only. </para>

        </para>

        <para>For writing the actual documents, the SUSE documentation team uses the official SUSE
            documentation workflow:</para>

        <para>
            <bridgehead>DocBookXML:</bridgehead> The documentation team writes all content to be
            published in DocBook XML. It is based on the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and
            defines the content in a semantic way through elements like in HTML. This makes changes
            and updates easier. In addition, the SUSE Best Practices use the same look-and-feel as
            the SUSE product documentation. </para>

        <para>
            <bridgehead>DocBook Authoring and Publishing Suite (DAPS):</bridgehead> DAPS is a
            command-line tool the SUSE documentation team uses to generate output formats from the
            XML sources. SUSE Best Practices will usually be provided as single HTML, PDF and ePub.
            DAPS also allows to implement a modular structure for a collection of papers related to
            a specific topic. It allows to run some other tasks related to writing and editing, such
            as spell checker and the SUSE documentation style checker. </para>

        <para>
            <bridgehead>Style:</bridgehead> The style of SUSE Best Practices should lean on the
            official style guidelines and existing stylesheets. However, they do not necessarily
            need to fulfill the guidelines by 100 percent. The language might be more narrative. The
            layout differs from a usual article. The &sbp; layout will be structured as follows:

            be outdated, and no subject matter expert volunteers to update the existing content.

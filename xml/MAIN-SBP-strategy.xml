        <title>Background</title>

        <para>In many enterprises, a lot of hidden IT knowledge and
            experience exists. This is also the case for SUSE, no matter
            which product you are looking at. For every product or
            solution, there are subject matter experts that have profound
            know-how and skills. </para>

        <para>Our consultants, sales engineers, supporters and partners
            work with our customers on a daily basis to implement,
            strengthen and fine-tune our solutions. They need to find the
            best options how to install third party software on top of our
            operating system, or to get the most out of our customers'
            infrastructure. Many proofs of concept and customer projects
            have been conducted. And many of them are at least partly
            documented. Also, many Technical Information Documents (TIDs)
            are already written and published on the webpage or in the
            Support Knowledgebase at <link
                xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/support/"/>, but it might
            be hard to find documents related to a specific topic.</para>

        <para>Our own infrastructure department has to solve challenges, or
            already detected easy ways to implement a scenario which might
            occur similarly or might be helpul in a customer setup. One of
            our engineers may have detected a certain solution, which is
            not yet documented, to address a common problem in a repeatable
            manner.</para>

        <para>This kind of information is usually <quote>buried</quote> on
            a personal laptop or a team server. Most of the existing
            documents are not in a shape that they can be published
                <quote>as are</quote>, because they refer to customers that
            we are not allowed to name or include some information that
            needs to be removed before publishing. </para>

        <para> In short, a huge part of the knowledge that exists in our
            company is not publicly available for our colleagues, partners
            or customers. And if publicly available in any form, it often
            is hard to find. </para>

            <para>The purpose of the &sbp; is to change this situation.
                We want to make existing knowledge and experience available
                to a broader audience, and we want to promote it via a
                recognizable series of documents.</para>

            <title>Vision</title>

            <para>With the &sbp;, we aim to introduce a new series of
                documents that provides reliable technical information. We
                want to establish a new <quote>go-to source</quote> for the
                usage and implementation of SUSE products and solutions,
                also in combination with third party software and
                hardware.</para>

            <para>Our goal is to make the &sbp; series similarly
                prominent to the widely recognized IBM Redbooks which can
                be found at <link xlink:href="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com"
                />. We want volunteers knocking at our door to contribute
                and feeling honored if we pick their proposed topics for
                the &sbp;.</para>
        </sect2>

        <sect2 xml:id="sec.whataresbp">
            <title>What Exactly Are the &sbp;?</title>

            <para>In contrast to the SUSE product documentation which
                mainly guides through SUSE software installation and usage,
                the &sbp; are a series of topic-driven documentation
                and provide installation and implementation
                experiences.</para>

            <para>A &sbp; document describes a technical scenario or
                solution that is not covered by the general comprehensive
                SUSE product documentation. Such a scenario can also
                include third-party software and implementations (partly)
                done by partners. </para>

            <para>While our SUSE product documentation is delivered in
                parallel with a new product version, the &sbp; will not
                focus on newly launched products, but on products already
                introduced to and established in the market.</para>

            <para>Usually the scenario or solution has already been
                implemented in a real-life scenario at a customer's site.
                It can include â€“ but is not limited to:</para>

            <para>&sbp; should be replicable and adaptable, they aim to

                replication, and they should be sustainable and easy to
                update.</para>

            <para>Depending on the complexity of the topic, &sbp; can
                differ regarding their length. Typically, a &sbp;
                document is between 5 and 30 pages in length. </para>

            <para>The support teams can save time and effort in reproducing

        <title>Definition of Whitepapers, Success Stories, Case Studies,
            Blogs</title>

        <para>In addition to the product documentation, SUSE provides
            written material to customers which is perceived by our
            customers as part of the SUSE <quote>documentation</quote>, but
            is created under responsibility of the Marketing teams. To
            avoid any confusion between the purpose of the &sbp; and
            Marketing material such as whitepapers, success stories, case
            studies, and blog entries, the next few paragraphs focus on the
            definition of these Marketing documents. </para>

        <para> The target audience for the Marketing documents are mainly
            technical or business <emphasis role="bold">decision
                makers</emphasis>. They mostly target potential customers
            that do not yet run SUSE products, or customers to whom we want
            to upsell additional SUSE products. Marketing documents are
            mainly used for <quote>Demand Generation</quote>. In Marketing
            language, <quote>Demand Generation</quote> means: creating
            interest in our products and services, and building and
            nurturing key prospect and customer relationships for the long
            term.</para>

        <para>You can find two different kinds of whitepapers at SUSE.
                <emphasis role="bold">Technical whitepapers</emphasis>
            provide a technical overview and are mainly product focused.
            They contain high level technical information, for example
            important technical features or technologies are explained and
                <quote>translated</quote> into their business benefits.
            These papers are written by Product Marketing. If required, the
            documentation team supports these whitepapers with proofreading
            or editing. <emphasis role="bold">Business
                whitepapers</emphasis> provide a business overview of a
            product or solution and focus mainly on the business value.
            Business whitepapers are completely done by the Marketing
            teams.</para>

        <para>A <emphasis role="bold">Success Story</emphasis> must include
            the customer name within the story. It is approximately two
            pages in length and explains how a customer successfully
            implemented our products. It contains high level details of a
            customer project, direct quotes from the customer, and paints a
            short picture of the project â€“ from start to finish. It covers
            the problem, solution and results from a business perspective,
            and reveals why our customer chose our product(s) for the
            project. </para>

        <para>A <emphasis role="bold">Case Study</emphasis> provides more
            details and specifics than a success story. In addition to the
            above, it showcases the <quote>how</quote> in the meaning of
            how a solution was delivered or how the solution works in the
            customerâ€™s environment. Case studies deliver much more in-depth
            technical information versus a success story. At SUSE, case
            studies are a minimum of four pages, and they must involve
            tangible measurements of results, such as cost savings or
            increases of efficiency. Their main purpose is to describe how
            a customer did benefit from the implementation of a SUSE
            product or solution by translating the technical information
            into measurable business results.</para>

        <para>SUSE also provides a platform for a <emphasis role="bold"
                >Corporate Blog</emphasis> at <link
                xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/communities/blog"/>. A
            Corporate blog is published and used by an organization as one
            channel to reach its organizational goals. Corporate blogging
            serves multiple potential marketing goals, from driving
            awareness, to providing specific information, to building up
            relationship. The advantage of corporate blogs is that posts
            and comments are easy to reach and follow due to centralized
            hosting and generally structured conversation threads. On a
            corporate blog, employees, teams, or spokespersons share their
            personal views on certain topics. These topics can be from
            technical or from business nature. The corporate blog is often
            used to announce new products, to explain and clarify policies,
            or to react on certain issues. It also allows a window to the
            company culture and is often treated more informally than
            traditional press releases, though a corporate blog often tries
            to accomplish similar goals as press releases do.</para>

    <sect1 xml:id="sec.prerequisites">
        <title>Prerequisites for &sbp;</title>

        <para>The main purpose of &sbp; is to make knowledge that
            already exists in written form in different departments of our
            company easily accessible for a broader internal and external
            audience. We can achieve this with the help of the
            documentation team via streamlined approaches and standardized
            processes.</para>

        <para>This means also that the main content for a &sbp; paper
            is not delivered by the SUSE documentation team, but has to

        <para>One reason why the SUSE documentation team cannot deliver the

        <bridgehead>Style</bridgehead>
        <para>The language style of a &sbp; adheres to the SUSE style
            guide. Use a clear and concise sentence structure. Avoid
            abbreviations and contractions. Use direct speech for &sbp;
            because they address the user, but avoid first person
            perspective. However, keep in mind that the style of a
            &sbp; can be take a more narrative form than a

            <title>Convincing the Teams that Have to Deliver the
                Content</title>

            <para>As most of the content for &sbp; needs to come from
                teams outside the enginnering departments, such as
                Consulting, Support, Alliances or Sales, we must get the
                buy-in from the respective directors and team leads.</para>

            <para>Most of them in direct conversations already agreed that
                content as planned to be provided with the &sbp; is
                needed and required by customers. However, the challenge is
                to transform the consense into a commitment.</para>

            <para>This commitment has to be twofold:</para>
            <orderedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>The directors and team leads need to
                            understand that for the &sbp; we need to
                            work with documentation that in big parts has
                            been created for projects or proof of concepts
                            for a specific customer. Typically we are not
                            allowed to use project-specific material for
                            public purposes. If we ask customers directly
                            to allow us to use the material, many of them
                            will object to it. </para>
                        <para> One way to circumvent this hurdle is to
                            include an official clause with our consulting
                            and sales contracts, which declares that
                            project or customer documentation can be reused
                            in an anonymized manner for SUSE documentation
                            purposes. </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>The managers of the Consulting, Support,
                            Alliances and Presales teams need to free up
                            some time of their team members for the work on
                            &sbp;. They need to understand that they
                            cannot charge the documentation team for the
                            time worked on &sbp;.</para>
                    </listitem>
                </orderedlist>
 

            <para>We will only get the commitment if we succeed to make the
                stakeholders in Consulting, Support, Alliances and Sales
                understand that the &sbp; represent a win-win
                situation. They will not hurt their customers, but benefit
                existing as well as potential new customers. In addition,
                they help our colleagues from these departments to save
                time as they do not have <quote>to reinvent the wheel for
                    many projects</quote> because they can rely on
                accessible documentation. </para>

            <para>The question is now how to approach the stakeholders from
                these departments? Should we approach them bottom-up or
                top-down? Do we talk to them ourselves in a first step, or
                do we ask our SUSE Senior Leadership team to approach them?
                If we decide for the bottom-up approach, can we secure
                backing from the Senior Leadership Team to put some
                pressure on them?</para>

            <title>Communication and Promotion of &sbp;</title>

            <para>First of all, we need to get official approval for the
                &sbp; from the ELT. A presentation about the &sbp;
                must be created for this purpose. We already have buy-in
                from our CTO Thomas Di Giacomo.</para>

            <para>To communicate the &sbp; internally and promote them
                externally, we need to work with the Marketing
                departments.</para>

            <para>Before we can make anything public, we should have a
                conversation with Jo Harris and her directors, and get
                their buy-in, too. Mainly Product Marketing provides high
                level technical whitepapers. We need to make Marketing
                understand that we do not compete with them by providing
                additonal whitepapers, but that we deliver additional
                material which they can also use for Marketing purposes and
                which nobody provided so far via streamlined processes. </para>

            <para>After that conversation took place, we should cooperate
                with Marketing to communicate the &sbp; to our
                colleagues. There are several channels: </para>

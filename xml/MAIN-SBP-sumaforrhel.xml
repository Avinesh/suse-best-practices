            <para>The described solution allows you to directly connect SUSE Manager to the Red Hat
                Content Delivery Network to retrieve your software updates and patches. This is
                useful if you <itemizedlist>

            <para>In a first step, you need to do download the manifest file from Red Hat. To
                achieve this just follow the documentation from Red Hat which is posted here:</para>
            <para> Managing On-Premise Subscription Management Applications <link
                    xlink:href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/managing-sam.html"

            </para>

            <para>The documentation will show you how to set up an organization in the Red Hat
                Portal and download your manifest file via the Red Hat Customer Portal. The manifest
                file also includes an entitlement SSL certificate that will be used later for
                authentication to the Content Delivery Network. </para>

            <para>The file name will look similar to the below. </para>

            <para>The Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) at the end of the file name will be
                different for every customer. Unzip the manifest file which will reveal another zip
                archive that looks like this:</para>

            <para>The size of the output has been reduced here, but you can clearly see this archive
                contains quite a few components. The only components we care about are what is
                listed under export/entitlement_certificates/. As you can see from the output above,
                the file under /export/entitlement_certificates is a .pem file with a long number.
                This file is used as both the SSL Client Certificate and SSL Client Key when you
                import it into SUSE Manager. For now just copy this file to another location of your
                choosing. It will be referenced later. </para>

            <title>Red Hat CA Certificate</title>

            <para>Next step is to get the Red Hat CA Certificate file. There might be multiple
                locations for this file, but the one place you can find them for sure is on the
                GitHub pages for the Katello project which is used in product Red Hat Satellite 6.
                So its not surprising that its out there since you can use Katello standalone to
                connect to the Red Hat CDN. You can find the link here: </para>

                />
            </para>

            <note>
                <title>Additional source for Red Hat CA Certificate files</title>
                <para> Another way to get this file is from the Red Hat Subscription Management
                    product. Once it is installed the file is located at
                    /etc/rhsm/ca/redhat-uep.pem</para>
            </note>

            <para>Save the file in raw format to your local system. Just like in the screen shot
                below, right click the <emphasis role="bold">Raw</emphasis> button. After that,
                click <emphasis role="bold">save link as</emphasis> or a similar method depending on
                your desktop environment. Save the file as redhat-uep.pem and put it in the same
                location where you put the entitlement certificate from <xref
                    linkend="sec.entitlecert"/>. We will reference it in the
                next section.</para>

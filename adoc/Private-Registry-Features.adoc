|Harbor Feature |Description |Feature Specifics |Notes |Supported by {spr}

.14+.^|User Authentication & Authorization
.4+.^|Supported backends for user authentication and authorization.
|Database
|
^|{tick}

|LDAP
.3+|To change the authentication mode from database to LDAP, OIDC or UAA no local users should be registered to the database.
If there is at least one user other than `admin` in the Harbor database, it is not possible to change the authentication mode.
^|{tick}

|OIDC
^|{cross}

|UAA
^|{tick}

.7+.^|Access to resources are controlled using RBAC where the following roles can applied to users
|Limited Guest
a|
* Can pull images but cannot push
* Cannot see logs or the other members of a project
^|{tick}

|Guest
a|
* Can pull and retag images, but cannot push
* Read-only privilege for a specified project
^|{tick}

|Developer
a|
* Read and write privileges for a project
^|{tick}

|Master
a|
* Same as Developer plus can scan images, view replications jobs, and delete images and helm charts
^|{tick}

|ProjectAdmin
a|
* Same as Master plus some management privileges, such as adding and removing members
^|{tick}

|System Admin
a|
* Same as ProjectAdmin plus can also list all projects, set an ordinary user as administrator, delete users and set vulnerability scan policy for all images
^|{tick}

|Anonymous
a|
* Has no access to private projects
* Has read-only access to public projects
^|{tick}

.3+|A project contains all repositories of an application. Images cannot be pushed to Harbor before a project is created. RBAC is applied to projects, so that only users with the appropriate roles can perform certain operations.
|Public
|Any user can pull images from this project. This is a convenient way for a user to share repositories with others.
^|{tick}

|Private
|Only users who are members of the project can pull images
^|{tick}

|Quota
|Quotas are applied on projects to limit the amount of storage capacity that a project can consume.
^|{tick}

|Logging
|Registry events such as pushing and deleting images are logged and available for querying by an ordinary user (project level) and an admin user (system level)
|

a|
Logs can be filtered by:

* Push only
* Pull only
* Pull and push
* Delete only
* All
* Push and delete
* Different date ranges
* Date range and push
^|{tick}

.2+|Labels
.2+|Labels can be created on different levels and assigned to images. Can be used for filtering
|global
a|
* System admin can create/edit/delete
* Available for all projects
^|{tick}

|project
a|
* Project admin can create/edit/delete
* Available for a specific project
^|{tick}


.12+.^|OCI Compliant Registry
.8+.^|The registry must support versioning, storing and distributing the following contents
|Multi-architecture images
a|
* Requires experimental features enabled on the Docker client
* Multi-arch images are created using the manifests feature
^|{tick}

|Container images
|
^|{tick}

.2+|Helm charts
a|* helm 2
^|{cross}
a|* helm 3
^|{tick}

|Cloud Native Application Bundles
a|
* CNAB is composed by a set of images and a manifest.
* The registry must be able to understand how to present a CNAB
* link:https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-to-oci[cnab-to-oci]
^|{tick}

|Artifacts
a|
* A single or multiple files can be pushed/pulled to/from the registry
* link:https://github.com/deislabs/oras[oras]
^|{tick}

|Tags
|Convey useful information about a specific image or chart version/variant.
They are aliases to the ID of an image.
^|{tick}

|Repository
|A repository can hold many objects (stored as tags)
^|{tick}

.4+|Any client that is able to consume the OCI API can interact with the registry
|Docker
|
^|{tick}

|Podman/CRIO
|
^|{cross}

|Helm 2
|Helm 2 is not OCI compatible.
^|{cross}

|Helm 3
|
^|{tick}

.3+|Replication
.3+|Replication allows users to replicate resources (e.g. images and charts) between Harbor and non-Harbor registries, in both pull or push mode.
|SUSE Registry
|link:https:registry.suse.com[]
^|{tick}

|Docker Hub
|
^|{tick}

|Docker Registry
|
^|{tick}

.2+|Content Trust
.2+|The registry must provide the ability to use digital signatures to allow client-side or runtime verification of the integrity and publisher of specific images.

|Signed Images
|Publishers can sign their images and image consumers can ensure that the images they pull are signed
^|{tick}

|Project Level Trust
|Projects with content trust enable does not allow pulling unsigned images
^|{tick}

.3+|Image Vulnerability Scanning
.2+|Provides static analysis of vulnerabilities in images through the following open source projects or other compatible scanners (link:https://github.com/anchore/harbor-scanner-adapter[Anchore], link:https://github.com/aquasecurity/harbor-scanner-aqua[CSP], link:https://github.com/dosec-cn/harbor-scanner/blob/master/README_en.md[DoSec])
|Trivy
|
^|{tick}

|Clair
|
^|{cross}

|Artifacts subject to a CVE might not be permitted to run. CVEs whitelists enable the scanner to ignore those CVEs
|CVE Whitelists
|
^|{tick}

|Garbage Collection
|Deleted images does not automatically free up space. Garbage collection must be executed to free up space by removing blobs that are no longer referenced by a manifest from the file system
|
|While it is running Harbor goes into read-only mode. All modifications to the registry are prohibited.
^|{tick}

.2+|Tag Policies
.2+a|
As a Harbor system administrator, it is possible to define rules that govern how many artifacts of a given repository to retain, or for how long to retain certain artifacts.

Harbor also allows the creation of tag immutability rules at the project level, so that artifacts with certain tags cannot be pushed into Harbor if their tags match existing tags
|Retention
|Rules that govern how many artifacts of a given repository to retain, or for how long to retain certain artifacts.
^|{tick}

|Immutability
a|Artifacts with certain tags cannot be pushed into Harbor if their tags match existing tags. This prevents existing artifacts from being overwritten.
Tag immutability guarantees that an immutable tagged artifact cannot be deleted, and also cannot be altered in any way such as through re-pushing, re-tagging, or replication from another target registry.
^|{tick}

|Robot Accounts
a|
Robot accounts can be used to run automated operations.
Robot accounts have the following limitations:

* Robot accounts cannot log in to the Harbor interface.
* Robot accounts can only perform operations by using the Docker and Helm CLIs.

.2+|Webhooks
.2+|Webhooks allows the integration of Harbor with other tools to streamline continuous integration and development processes by sending notifications based on certain events that occur in the project
|HTTP
.2+|Webhook notifications provide information about events in JSON format and are delivered by HTTP or HTTPS POST

|SLACK

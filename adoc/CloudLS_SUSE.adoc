== SUSE and the Cloud

SUSE is a very active member of the OpenStack Community and has a long
track record of participating in the OpenStack development. 

The company also has a proven history of implementing cloud setups in 
customer organizations. From small local installations to large public 
scale-out environments and complex scenarios, SUSE consultants, support 
engineers and developers are prepared to help customers.  

In addition, SUSE provides several Linux-based products that customers 
can use to bootstrap their cloud project quickly, efficiently and reliably.

=== SUSE Linux Enterprise Server

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is the Linux distribution tailored
specifically to the requirements of enterprise workloads. It is a 
multi-modal operating system that paves the way for IT transformation in the 
software-defined era. This modern operating system makes traditional IT 
infrastructure efficient and provides an engaging platform for developers. 
As a result, you can easily deploy and transition business-critical workloads 
across on-premise and public cloud environments.

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server shares a _common code base_ with all other products 
that are based on the SUSE Linux Enterprise platform. This means the versions, 
and thereby the source code, of all core packages of the SUSE Linux Enterprise 
product family are the same â€” from the desktop to the mainframe. The toolchain 
is the same across the supported hardware architectures. The common 
code base guarantees that the product and its look-and-feel is consistent. 
The latest software enhancements, bug fixes and security patches are delivered 
as regular updates via the SUSE Customer Center, so you have the newest 
functionality and the best hardware support.

=== SUSE OpenStack Cloud

SUSE OpenStack Cloud is the open source cloud solution of choice maintained 
by SUSE and designed for enterprises. It contains all standard OpenStack services 
and tools to allow for an easy installation and seamless maintenance of clouds of
any size. Thanks to SUSE's long-term experience with OpenStack technologies, it 
also comes with a generic configuration yet prepared for most use cases.

SUSE OpenStack Cloud provides a Software-Defined Infrastructure-as-a-Service 
(IaaS) for your data center. It lets you set up your own cloud environment 
in a very short time, with access to pools of IT resources to quickly deploy 
and run applications. This gives you the flexibility to respond quickly 
and easily to new demands, providing the ideal platform for increased 
innovation, while helping you to control and reduce costs.

size.

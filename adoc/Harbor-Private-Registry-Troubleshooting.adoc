== Troubleshooting

The installation using Helm is fully automated and should succeed when the requirements are met.
After a few seconds, the ingress controller configured path should be responding with the login screen of an admin UI, see the <<administration>> section.

In case of issues, please make sure all pods in registry namespace are running and all deployments are in the Ready state.
If a pod fails to start, investigate the situation with your debugging tool of choice (link:https://k9scli.io/[k9s], or kubectl).

Private registry deploys in the given {kube} namespace multiple deployments and one statefulset, and all of them should be healthy.

=== Possible problems

* As mentioned in the requirements, ingress-controller needs to be set up in your {kube} cluster
* When accessing the web UI, the browser complains about unknown certificate.
+
Check the <<install-tls-security>> for a solution.
* Images for various {spr} components cannot be found, and Pods are not getting created.
+
Make sure registry.suse.com is accessible from your network.
* Pods are not starting, most of them fail with `failed to connect to database` pod error.
+
Check the errors in the database pod. Does it complain with something like:
+
----
FailedScheduling <unknown> default-scheduler pod has unbound immediate `PersistentVolumeClaims`
----
+
(repeated 2 times)? Possible reason is that the `storageClass` is missing or no `storageClass` is marked as default.

[#install-tls-security]
== Transport Layer Security (TLS) Setup

=== Generated certificates

With default setup, the {spr} public APIs (the UI and the OCI registry API) will both use an auto-generated certificate.
To avoid root certificate validation errors, the generated CA certificate should be installed on all hosts that will need to connect to it:

* All cluster nodes, if a {kube} cluster will be used to pull images from the {spr}
* All machines where supported OCI clients, such as docker engine and helm v3 are running, if those clients will be used to interact with the {spr}

How to extract the generated CA certificate:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n registry get secret
----

Find the secret whose name ends with -harbor-ingress (default setup, when the services were exposed via Ingress) or -harbor-nginx (when the services were exposed via LoadBalancer).

Extract the certificate from the secret:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n registry get secret <secret-name> -o jsonpath="{.data.ca\.crt}" | base64 --decode > harbor.ca
----

Install the extracted CA certificate system-wide:

[source,bash]
----
su
cp harbor.ca /usr/share/pki/trust/anchors/
update-ca-certificates
----

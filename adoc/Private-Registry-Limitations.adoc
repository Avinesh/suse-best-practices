== Limitations

* Once an authentication method is chosen and a user other than admin is added, the authentication method can not be changed without deploying a completely fresh registry.
* High availability and scalability are not available for the internal redis and database components. Use external database and redis services to compensate this limitation.
* Internal TLS can be enabled to secure internal connections between the {spr} components.
This doesn't currently cover the internal database and internal redis components.
* Securing connections to the external Redis with TLS/SSL is currently not supported.
* Accuracy of the Image scanning using `Trivy` might be limited.
* GPG signing for OCI artifacts is currently not supported. The only method for signing OCI artifacts is TUF (The Update Framework), provided by the `Notary` component.
